    "Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.\n",

You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '**TODO**' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app."

The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently.

Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the `model_fn()` method from the `train.py` file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, `if __name__ == '__main__':` )\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until *you* shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.\n",

    "Positive review for \"Deadpool\" movie\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before Logan, this was my favorite non-MCU marvel movie. The humor lands every single time thanks to Ryan Reynolds' charismatic and hysterical performance. The action was really well-helmed, which i think benefits from the fact that none of it is censored (disney if u make DP3 don't censor it). It also does a great job fleshing out Wade Wilson's character, instead of making him a service-level comedian; they showed us his prior life and love life, and it was executed very well. Overall, this is a badass and hilarious x-men film, and a really damn good time.\n",

    "A very negative review for \"Deadpool\" move\n",
    "```\n",
    "The film is made out of Ryan Reynolds, throwing lame jokes to the camera. In between there are bullets and knifes. No surprises. No ideas. The story is simple and silly and boring. Man sleeps with woman long in different scenes (Teens hello! Better watch porn, there are more details!) Man go's to basement to become special. (Teens like to be special) Man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him. THE END\n",
    "\n",
    "The jokes are not only lame, they are old. For example the joke with the red shirt and brown trousers I heard from my grandpa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't waste your time with this film. Marvell tries to squeeze out last cents out of the theme. Bad films will follow.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Was also detected as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "With so-so one (5/10 stars user rating):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The long awaited Deadpool is finally and with its much talked about \"hard R\" rating. Starring Ryan Reynolds as a quick taking, fourth- wall breaking, insult throwing, masked superhero, we hear about how Deadpool became Deadpool told in flashback sequences, while simultaneously following a present day plot as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question for the average movie goer is \"Is this film really as good and as raunchy as everyone says?\" No it isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't mean to ramble much so I'll start with the good, this film does have some humorous moments and most of the supporting characters are very entertaining to watch. And yes this film also does have some good action sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, that is where the good ends. This films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy, as well as claiming to not be your average Marvel film because of those following reasons. But let me assure you; This film is most definitely very similar to all of the other Marvel films. By saying \"fuck\" a few times, showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as \"dicktits\" is not smart filmmaking or screen writing. It is easy adolescent humor. This film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you. I have seen good comedies and I have seen good superhero films and this excels in neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this films defense it may not try to be anything other than feel- good-fun-turn-your-brain-off type film, but that within itself is lazy filmmaking. I shouldn't have to turn my brain off to have enjoy a film.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which is I guess fair since it's a bit more positive than negative.\n",

    "We've spent a lot of time playing The Witcher 3. After completing it back in 2015 when it first launched, we're now deep into the Nintendo Switch version and still loving every minute of the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can forgive a dodgy camera angle here, a bit too much nipple there, or even a misbehaving horse bumping into yet another tree, because all those other glimmering moments of brilliance amount to something greater. The Switch version also comes with all the downloadable content (DLC) latched on too, creating an even more complete experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "You needn't be a diehard fantasy genre fan either: The Witcher 3's massive world, gorgeous landscapes, balanced gameplay, detailed quests and story are all compelling enough to hook you in and keep you there. Just be prepared to sacrifice your normal life because you'll be scratching around trying to find the dozens of extra hours you'll want to spend playing it.\n",

    "Model seemed to correctly identify it as positive.\n",
